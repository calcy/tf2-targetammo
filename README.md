Team Fortress 2 Target Ammo Viewer
==============

This plugin for Sourcemod will show the current ammo of any teammate you are currently targeting in your crosshair and/or healing (if you are a medic).  It is my first sourcemod script and still very much a work in progress.

TODO
----

* Add functionality for spies to see enemy information
* Test effects of aiming at/healing disguised enemy spies
* Fix default positions and colors of ammo text
* Make text stop flickering (maybe use onGameFrame() instead of a timer every X.XX seconds?)
* Test output of non-damage weapons
* Add Soldier rage meters and Pyro "mmmph" meter
* Have client-side options to turn off/on plugin and for position on screen
